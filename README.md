# thruster-test-stand
Repository for the OSU UWRT Thruster Test Stand code.

Notes:

- Remember to hook up the battery to the ESC when you are ready to run the thruster.
- Edit constants in the .ino file to change testing parameters.

- Running the python script will listen for the thruster and save the data to a CSV file.
- To run the python script simply enter `python ThrusterTestStand.py`
- You may want to change the filename and device port in the python script if it is not running properly. These will be added as command line arguments in future versions of this code.
